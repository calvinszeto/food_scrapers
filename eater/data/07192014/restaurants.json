This regular feature seeks to list the city's key dining establishments (with a few representatives from the suburbs), on both the high and low end of the scale and with a special emphasis on the defining meals that make the city and region move. This is our answer to that age-old question,  \"Can you recommend a restaurant...\"  These are not the best restaurants in the city, or the most buzzy (check the monthly   for that). These are the restaurants that represent a taste of the city. These are the places that make Detroit, (and Metro Detroit)  in no particular order, other than somewhat geographic. This time around we said \"goodbye\" for now to  Taqueria Lupitas ,  Inn Season , and  Avalon Bakery .  Noble Fish ,  Taqueria El Rey , and legendary restaurant  The Lark  were welcomed to the family, and will hopefully stay for a nice long while. The list is updated every quarter, with any restaurant left out or just starting up getting a fair shake in the interim.  Did we leave out your classic Detroit eatery?    and maybe we'll join you there soon.

Mining the restaurants found on www.eater.com lists and relevant data.

Running this scraper requires a Splash server (https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash) running on the default port 8050. AFAIK, Splash is installed using the setup.py (I couldn't find it with pip).

TODO:
Generalize spider for any given list.
Mine other lists

Add geolocation data to database
Add other information to database

Refactoring:
Convert folders to Python modules and run.sh to a python script.
